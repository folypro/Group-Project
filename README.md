# TEAM-1 HELLO BOIS

Team 1 Read me file - Zach Bowman

The project that was selected 
is a Mortgage Calculator using JavaFX.
We know the housing market rates are skyrocketing!
People are going to need to know what the new rates are.

Zach Bowman - This is the first time being
in a team and thinking of a role. I am not sure how it works.
I would like to be the one who handles the inputs of the project
and calculate/send them back to the main.

Abdulbasit Adeniji- Since Zach is taking the role of send input back to the main, I will be doing the layout of the application
(stage, scene, etc....). And if we are using any database I can also handle that and give someone else the layout.

Andrew Angell- regarding my role in this, ill be handling debugging and checking to ensure that the code within this functions properly.
id also like to help with doing said calculations.

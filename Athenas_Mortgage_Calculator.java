// Athena's Mortgage Calculator
// Description: This program will take the user's information, loan amount, loan term, loan rate.
// It will then display back to the user information on the loan and how much they will be paying monthly.

// Zach Bowman -- For other in the team, I have started getting the outline of our project together.
// I will commit this to github so everyone can add their touches and part to it before it is due.
// Please make sure to help with the outline of our project or add something.
